 SNAKE-GAME
 The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to eat food that appears randomly on the screen. 
 The snake grows longer with each piece of food it consumes, making the game increasingly challenging as the player must avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
